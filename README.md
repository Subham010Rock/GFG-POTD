## Problem No. 2- [Partition a Linked List around a given value](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/partition-a-linked-list-around-a-given-value/1#)
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come first, then all nodes with value equal to x and finally nodes with value greater than or equal to x. The original relative order of the nodes in each of the three partitions should be preserved. The partition must work in-place.

Solution-

```

struct Node* partition(struct Node* head, int x) {
    // code here
    struct Node* h1,*h2,*h3,*iter1,*iter2,*iter3;
    h1=h2=h3=iter1=iter2=iter3=NULL;
    while(head!=NULL){
        struct Node*temp=new Node(head->data);
        if(head->data<x){
            if(h1==NULL){
                h1=temp;
                iter1=temp;
            }
            else{
                iter1->next=temp;
                iter1=temp;
            }
        }
        else if(head->data==x){

                iter3=temp;
            }
        }
        head=head->next;
    }
    if(h1==NULL){

## Problem No. 3-[Theft at World Bank](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/theft-at-the-world-bank2156/1#)
The worlds most successful thief Albert Spaggiari was planning for his next heist on the world bank. He decides to carry a sack with him, which can carry a maximum weight of C kgs. Inside the world bank there were N large blocks of gold. All the blocks have some profit value associated with them i.e. if he steals ith block of weight w[i] then he will have p[i] profit. As blocks were heavy he decided to steal some part of them by cutting them with his cutter.
The thief does not like symmetry, hence, he wishes to not take blocks or parts of them whose weight is a perfect square. Now, you need to find out the maximum profit that he can earn given that he can only carry blocks of gold in his sack. 
Note: The answer should be precise upto 3 decimal places.

Solution- 

```
class Solution{
	public:
	static bool sqr(long long n){
	    if(ceil(sqrt(n))==floor(sqrt(n)))
	    return true;

	    return false;
	}
	long double maximumProfit(int N, long long C, vector<long long> w, vector<long long> p){
	    // Code here.
	    long double res=0;
	    vector<pair<long double,long long>>v;
	    for(int i=0;i<w.size();i++){
	        if(!sqr(w[i])){
	            v.push_back(make_pair(((long double)p[i]/w[i]),w[i]));

## Problem No. 8-[Shop in Candy Store](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shop-in-candy-store1145/1#)
In a candy store, there are N different types of candies available and the prices of all the N different types of candies are provided to you. You are now provided with an attractive offer. You can buy a single candy from the store and get at most K other candies ( all are different types ) for free. Now you have to answer two questions. Firstly, you have to find what is the minimum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies. Secondly, you have to find what is the maximum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies. In both the cases you must utilize the offer i.e. you buy one candy and get K other candies for free.

## Problem No. 9-[Find length of Loop](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-length-of-loop/1#)
Given a linked list of size N. The task is to complete the function countNodesinLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains a loop or not and if the loop is present then return the count of nodes in a loop or else return 0. C is the position of the node to which the last node is connected. If it is 0 then no loop.
